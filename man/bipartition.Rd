\title{Bipartition a sample set}
\usage{
bipartition(data, tol = 1e-05, nonneg = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{dense or sparse matrix of features in rows and samples in columns. Prefer \code{matrix} or \code{Matrix::dgCMatrix}, respectively}

\item{tol}{tolerance of the fit}

\item{nonneg}{enforce non-negativity of the rank-2 factorization used for bipartitioning}

\item{...}{development parameters}
}
\value{
A list giving the bipartition and useful statistics:
\itemize{
\item v       : vector giving difference between sample loadings between factors in a rank-2 factorization
\item dist    : relative cosine distance of samples within a cluster to centroids of assigned vs. not-assigned cluster
\item size1   : number of samples in first cluster (positive loadings in 'v')
\item size2   : number of samples in second cluster (negative loadings in 'v')
\item samples1: indices of samples in first cluster
\item samples2: indices of samples in second cluster
\item center1 : mean feature loadings across samples in first cluster
\item center2 : mean feature loadings across samples in second cluster
}
}
\description{
Spectral biparitioning by rank-2 matrix factorization
}
\details{
Spectral bipartitioning is a popular subroutine in divisive clustering. The sign of the difference between sample loadings in factors of a rank-2 matrix factorization
gives a bipartition that is nearly identical to an SVD.

Rank-2 matrix factorization by alternating least squares is faster than rank-2-truncated SVD (i.e. \emph{irlba}).

This function is a specialization of rank-2 \code{\link{nmf}} with support for factorization of only a subset of samples, and with additional calculations on the factorization model relevant to bipartitioning. See \code{\link{nmf}} for details regarding rank-2 factorization.

\section{Advanced Parameters}{

Several parameters may be specified in the \code{...} argument:
\itemize{
\item \code{diag = TRUE}: scale factors in \eqn{w} and \eqn{h} to sum to 1 by introducing a diagonal, \eqn{d}. This should generally never be set to \code{FALSE}. Diagonalization enables symmetry of models in factorization of symmetric matrices, convex L1 regularization, and consistent factor scalings.
\item \code{samples = 1:ncol(A)}: samples to include in bipartition, numbered from 1 to \code{ncol(A)}. Default is all samples.
\item \code{calc_dist = TRUE}: calculate the relative cosine distance of samples within a cluster to either cluster centroid. If \code{TRUE}, centers for clusters will also be calculated.
\item \code{seed = NULL}: random seed for model initialization, generally not needed for rank-2 factorizations because robust solutions are recovered when \code{diag = TRUE}
\item \code{maxit = 100}: maximum number of alternating updates of \eqn{w} and \eqn{h}. Generally, rank-2 factorizations converge quickly and this should not need to be adjusted.
